CS 1622: Compiler Design

System Requirements
-------------------

* JFlex


Instructions
------------

To compile the lexer, parser, and compiler, run:

    make

You may invoke the compiler directly:

    cd build
    java JavaCompiler ../example/Factorial.java

...or you may invoke it via a convenient script:

    ./bin/mjavac example/Factorial.java

There are sample MiniJava source files in the example/ directory. These examples
are provided by the MiniJava Project[1]. There are also some sample files in the
same directory designed to cause parse and name errors.

Unfortunately, I was only able to implement parse error handling and name
analysis. Type checking and IR generation have not been implemented.
